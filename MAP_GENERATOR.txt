=== SECTION: MAP_GENERATION_BOOTSTRAP ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Your output must strictly adhere to the module formatting rules defined in LLM_FORMATTING_GUIDELINES_TEMPLATE. 

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
Generate hierarchical map modules for use in a character operating system. All output must be parseable as a native module.

[KEEP: Rules for Map Creation]
1. Generate maps in module format only. Use SECTION headers, SECTION_BREAK, and [KEY_TERM: Document Complete] exactly as specified.
2. Each map must have:
   - Map_ID (unique)
   - Name
   - Type (Indoor, Outdoor, Hybrid)
   - Parent_Map (NULL if top-level)
   - Coordinate_System (e.g., Grid, 5x5 feet)
   - Rooms with Dimensions, Transition_Points, Moveable_Objects, Immovable_Objects
   - General_Sensory_Data (Auditory, Visual, Olfactory, Tactile, Thermal)
3. Nested maps are allowed. Use Transition_Points to reference another Map_ID (must exist in registry). 
4. All sensory, dimension, and object data must be internally consistent.
5. NEVER break SECTION rules, and do not use standard Markdown.
6. For any nested map, create the sub-map as a separate module with identical formatting.
7. Only output one map module per request unless explicitly asked to batch-create maps.
8. Assign unique URLs/Map_IDs for all generated maps for registry integration.

[KEEP: Example Map Structure]

=== SECTION: EXAMPLE_MAP ===
Map_ID: EXAMPLE_01
Name: "Dilapidated Farmhouse"
Type: Indoor
Parent_Map: NULL
Coordinate_System: Grid, 5x5 feet, North-West N1W1

General_Sensory_Data:
  Auditory: Crickets, wind in trees
  Olfactory: Damp plaster, musty wood
  Tactile: Grimy floor
  Thermal: Slightly warm

Rooms:
  Living_Room:
    Dimensions: 20x15
    Transition_Points:
      N4W2: [DOOR] Front Door (Locked) → EXTERNAL_MAP: STREET_MAIN
      N2W4: [WINDOW] Broken Window → NESTED_MAP: BARN_INTERIOR
    Moveable_Objects:
      N1W2: Couch
      N3W3: TV
    Immovable_Objects:
      N3W2: Chain bolted to floor

[KEY_TERM: Document Complete]

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: Generate a new map module now following the structure above. Ensure all rooms, transition points, and objects are fully described. Assign a unique Map_ID and prepare for registry integration.
