=== SECTION: MAP_GENERATION_BOOTSTRAP ===

[[LLM_INSTRUCTION]]: When generating map modules for this MAP_GENERATOR, you MUST strictly adhere to LLM_FORMATTING_GUIDELINES_TEMPLATE. All output must be fully parseable as a native module, using the section and break architecture found in SYSTEM_REF_*.txt files.

[KEEP: Purpose & Role]
Establishes absolute rules for the generation of hierarchical map modules for use in character operating systems. Ensures that all output is machine-parseable, structurally consistent, and compliant with system-level formatting standards.

=== SECTION_BREAK ===

=== SECTION: Core Map Generation Rules ===

- Map modules MUST use section headers in the format: `=== SECTION: [Section Name] ===`
- Place `=== SECTION_BREAK ===` ONLY after the content of each section and IMMEDIATELY before the next section header or [KEY_TERM: Document Complete].
- Every map module must have:
    - Map_ID (unique, registry-compatible)
    - Name (string)
    - Type (Indoor, Outdoor, Hybrid)
    - Parent_Map (Map_ID or NULL)
    - Coordinate_System (e.g., Grid, 5x5 feet, origin point)
    - General_Sensory_Data (Auditory, Olfactory, Tactile, Thermal, Visual; each as a hyphen list)
    - Rooms (see below)
- All room Dimensions MUST be exact multiples of the grid size (e.g., 5x5, 10x10, 15x20; NO partial squares or irregular sizes). This applies to both width and length.
- All room coordinates, Transition_Points, and object positions MUST correspond to valid grid squares within the stated room Dimensions.
- Sensory data and object placements MUST be internally consistent and never contradict the environment or grid.
- Nested maps are permitted. For a transition leading to another map, the referenced Map_ID MUST exist or be generated separately as its own module.
- NEVER use Markdown, pipe tables, or technical formatting outside system markers.
- Only output one map module per request unless explicitly instructed to batch-generate.
- Strictly enforce two-space indentation for all nested items.
- Use `- ` for all lists (including sensory data).
- Custom markers like [KEY_TERM:], ((SYSTEM_REF: ...)), and [KEEP:] must remain intact and used only as defined in system templates.
- End every module with `=== SECTION_BREAK ===` immediately followed by `[KEY_TERM: Document Complete]` and nothing else.
